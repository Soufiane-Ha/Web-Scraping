- Support for Scientific Research

The process typically involves:

- Sending an HTTP request to the website

- Analyzing page content (HTML parsing)

- Extracting the required elements

- Storing the results in a structured format (CSV/JSON/Database)

It is a technique for extracting data from web pages using programming scripts, often in Python, with the aim of:
